# Polyspace Access Utility

Polyspace Access Utility is a bash script for dealing with basic operations when using PolyspaceÂ® Access&trade;:
- backup (save and restore)
- clean-up
- statistics
- restart
- debug

The script is compatible with Polyspace Access R2022a, R2022b and R2023a

# Installation

The tool should be installed in a subfolder of the Polyspace Access installation.  
Before using the tool, you may have to set execution rights to the two bash scripts:

```
chmod u+x access_util.sh access_debug.sh 
```

Since it is a simple bash script, there is else nothing to install. It is using the tool whiptail, which is installed by default on most Linux distributions.
If whiptail is not installed, you can install it like this:

```
 sudo apt install whiptail
```

# Usage

Launch the script `access_util.sh` in su mode. The script will then read the Polyspace Access configuration files to get the settings used by Polyspace Access.  
In the menu, use up and down cursor keys to chose the command to be launched then Enter to validate your choice.  
A log file named log.txt is written in case of a problem.


# Warning

The tool relies on commands (including SQL requests) that are not maintained and that may change in further releases of Polyspace Access.
